               And stole into the covert of the wood;<br />
               I, measuring his affections by my own,<br />
               Which then most sought where most might not be found,<br />
               Being one too many by my weary self,<br />

               Love is a smoke rais'd with the fume of sighs;<br />
               Being purg'd, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;<br />
               Being vex'd, a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears.<br />

               For beauty starv'd with her severity<br />
               Cuts beauty off from all posterity.<br />
               She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,<br />

               She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow<br />

               We must talk in secret.--Nurse, come back again;<br />
               I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel.<br />

               She is not fourteen. How long is it now<br />
               To Lammas-tide?</span></p>
         
         
         <p class="F"><span class="C"><span class="speaker">Lady Capulet: </span>A fortnight and odd days.</span></p>

               Susan and she--God rest all Christian souls!--<br />
               Were of an age; well, Susan is with God,<br />
               She was too good for me; but, as I said,<br />
               On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;<br />
               That shall she, marry; I remember it well.<br />
               'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;<br />
               And she was wean'd,--I never shall forget it,--<br />
               Of all the days of the year, upon that day,<br />
               For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,<br />
               Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;<br />
               My lord and you were then at Mantua,--<br />
               Nay, I do bear a brain;--but, as I said,<br />
               When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple<br />
               Of my dug, and felt it bitter, pretty fool,<br />
               To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!<br />
               Shake, quoth the dove-house; 'twas no need, I trow,<br />
               To bid me trudge.<br />
               And since that time it is eleven years,<br />
               For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood,<br />
               She could have run and waddled all about.--<br />
               God mark thee to his grace!<br />
               Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nurs'd;<br />
               An I might live to see thee married once,<br />
               I have my wish.</span></p>

               I came to talk of.--Tell me, daughter Juliet,<br />
               How stands your disposition to be married?</span></p>

               Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,<br />

               I was your mother much upon these years<br />

               And find delight writ there with beauty's pen.<br />
               Examine every married lineament<br />
               And see how one another lends content;<br />
               And what obscur'd in this fair volume lies<br />
               Find written in the margent of his eyes.<br />
               This precious book of love, this unbound lover,<br />
               To beautify him, only lacks a cover;<br />
               The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride<br />
               For fair without the fair within to hide.<br />
               That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,<br />
               That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;<br />
               So shall you share all that he doth possess,<br />
               By having him making yourself no less.<br />
               Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?</span></p>

         <p class="M"><span class="N"><span class="speaker">Mercutio: </span>O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.<br />
               She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes<br />
               In shape no bigger than an agate-stone<br />
               On the fore-finger of an alderman,<br />
               Drawn with a team of little atomies<br />
               Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;<br />
               Her waggon-spokes made of long spinners' legs,<br />
               The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,<br />
               The traces of the smallest spider's web,<br />
               The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,<br />
               Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,<br />
               Her waggoner a small grey-coated gnat,<br />
               Not half so big as a round little worm<br />
               Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;<br />
               Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut<br />
               Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,<br />
               Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.<br />
               And in this state she gallops night by night<br />
               Through lover's brains, and then they dream of love;<br />
               O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight;<br />
               O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees;<br />
               O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream,<br />
               Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,<br />
               Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.<br />
               Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,<br />
               And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;<br />
               And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail<br />
               Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,<br />
               Then dreams he of another benefice.<br />
               Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,<br />
               And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,<br />
               Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,<br />
               Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon<br />
               Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,<br />
               And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two<br />
               And sleeps again. This is that very Mab<br />
               That plats the manes of horses in the night,<br />
               And bakes the elf-locks in foul sluttish hairs,<br />
               Which once untangled much misfortune bodes.<br />
               This is she--</span></p>
         
         
         <p class="M"><span class="M"><span class="speaker">Romeo: </span>Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!<br />

               Which is as thin of substance as the air,<br />
               And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes<br />
               Even now the frozen bosom of the North,<br />
               And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,<br />
               Turning his face to the dew-dropping South.</span></p>
         
         
         <p class="M"><span class="M"><span class="speaker">Benvolio: </span>This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves;<br />

               Some consequence, yet hanging in the stars,<br />

               With this night's revels, and expire the term<br />
               Of a despised life clos'd in my breast<br />

               I'll frown and be perverse and say thee nay,<br />
               So thou wilt woo, but else not for the world.<br />
               In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,<br />

               I should have been more strange, I must confess,<br />
               But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,<br />
               My true love's passion; therefore pardon me,<br />
               And not impute this yielding to light love,<br />
               Which the dark night hath so discovered.</span></p>

         <p class="M"><span class="N"><span class="speaker">Friar Laurence: </span>The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,<br />
               Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light,<br />
               And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels<br />
               From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels.<br />
               Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,<br />
               The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,<br />
               I must up-fill this osier cage of ours<br />
               With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.<br />
               The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;<br />
               What is her burying grave that is her womb,<br />
               And from her womb children of divers kind<br />
               We sucking on her natural bosom find,<br />
               Many for many virtues excellent,<br />
               None but for some, and yet all different.<br />
               O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies<br />
               In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities!<br />
               For nought so vile that on the earth doth live<br />
               But to the earth some special good doth give;<br />
               Nor aught so good but, strain'd from that fair use,<br />
               Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse.<br />
               Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied,<br />
               And vice sometime's by action dignified.<br />
               Within the infant rind of this weak flower<br />
               Poison hath residence, and medicine power;<br />
               For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part,<br />
               Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.<br />
               Two such opposed kings encamp them still<br />
               In man as well as herbs,--grace and rude will;<br />
               And where the worser is predominant,<br />
               Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.</span></p>

               So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed.<br />
               Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,<br />
               And where care lodges sleep will never lie;<br />
               But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain<br />
               Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign.<br />

               And all combin'd, save what thou must combine<br />
               By holy marriage. When and where and how<br />
               We met, we woo'd, and made exchange of vow,<br />
               I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,<br />

               Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.<br />
               Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine<br />
               Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!<br />
               How much salt water thrown away in waste,<br />
               To season love that of it doth not taste!<br />
               The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,<br />
               Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears;<br />
               Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit<br />
               Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet.<br />
               If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,<br />
               Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline;<br />
               And art thou chang'd? pronounce this sentence then:<br />
               Women may fall when there's no strength in men.</span></p>

               With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,<br />
               Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,<br />

               Cold death aside, and with the other sends<br />
               It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity<br />

               His agile arm beats down their fatal points,<br />

               An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life<br />

               Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death<br />
               Was woe enough, if it had ended there;<br />
               Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship<br />
               And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,<br />
               Why follow'd not, when she said Tybalt's dead,<br />
               Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,<br />
               Which modern lamentation might have mov'd?<br />
               But with a rearward following Tybalt's death,<br />
               'Romeo is banished!'--to speak that word,<br />
               Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,<br />
               All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished!'<br />
               There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,<br />
               In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.--<br />
               Where is my father, and my mother, nurse?</span></p>

               Both you and I, for Romeo is exil'd;<br />
               He made you for a highway to my bed,<br />
               But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.</span></p>

               Not body's death, but body's banishment.</span></p>
         
         
         <p class="M"><span class="M"><span class="speaker">Romeo: </span>Ha, banishment! be merciful, say death,<br />
               For exile hath more terror in his look,<br />

               Hence banished is banish'd from the world,<br />
               And world's exile is death. Then banished<br />
               Is death misterm'd; calling death banishment<br />
               Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe,<br />

               Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince,<br />
               Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,<br />
               And turn'd that black word death to banishment.<br />
               This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.</span></p>
         
         
         <p class="M"><span class="M"><span class="speaker">Romeo: </span>'Tis torture, and not mercy; heaven is here,<br />
               Where Juliet lives, and every cat and dog<br />
               And little mouse, every unworthy thing,<br />
               Live here in heaven and may look on her,<br />
               But Romeo may not. More validity,<br />
               More honourable state, more courtship lives<br />
               In carrion-flies than Romeo. They may seize<br />
               On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand<br />
               And steal immortal blessing from her lips,<br />
               Who, even in pure and vestal modesty,<br />
               Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;<br />
               But Romeo may not, he is banished.<br />
               This may flies do, when I from this must fly;<br />
               They are free men, but I am banished.<br />
               And say'st thou yet that exile is not death?<br />
               Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,<br />
               No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,<br />

               O friar, the damned use that word in hell,<br />
               Howling attends it; how hast thou the heart,<br />
               Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,<br />
               A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,<br />

               It helps not, it prevails not; talk no more.</span></p>

               That we have had no time to move our daughter.<br />
               Look you, she lov'd her kinsman Tybalt dearly,<br />
               And so did I.--Well, we were born to die.--<br />
               'Tis very late, she'll not come down to-night;<br />
               I promise you, but for your company,<br />
               I would have been a-bed an hour ago.</span></p>

               Madam, good night; commend me to your daughter.</span></p>
         
         
         <p class="F"><span class="C"><span class="speaker">Lady Capulet: </span>I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;<br />
               To-night she's mew'd up to her heaviness.</span></p>
         
         
         <p class="M"><span class="C"><span class="speaker">Capulet: </span>Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender<br />
               Of my child's love. I think she will be rul'd<br />
               In all respects by me; nay, more, I doubt it not.--<br />
               Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;<br />
               Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love,<br />
               And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next--<br />

               O' Thursday let it be; o' Thursday, tell her,<br />
               She shall be married to this noble earl.<br />
               Will you be ready? do you like this haste?<br />
               We'll keep no great ado,--a friend or two;<br />
               For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,<br />
               It may be thought we held him carelessly,<br />
               Being our kinsman, if we revel much.<br />
               Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,<br />
               And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?</span></p>
         
         
         <p class="M"><span class="N"><span class="speaker">Paris: </span>My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.</span></p>
         
         
         <p class="M"><span class="C"><span class="speaker">Capulet: </span>Well, get you gone; o' Thursday be it then.--<br />
               Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,<br />
               Prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day.--<br />
               Farewell, my lord.--Light to my chamber, ho!<br />

               It was the nightingale, and not the lark,<br />
               That pierc'd the fearful hollow of thine ear;<br />
               Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree.<br />
               Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.</span></p>

               Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day<br />
               Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.<br />
               I must be gone and live, or stay and die.</span></p>

               And light thee on thy way to Mantua;<br />

               'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;<br />
               Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat<br />
               The vaulty heaven so high above our heads.<br />

               Is not so long as is a tedious tale.<br />
               Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;<br />
               And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife.<br />
               I married them; and their stolen marriage-day<br />
               Was Tybalt's doomsday, whose untimely death<br />
               Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from this city,<br />
               For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin'd.<br />
               You, to remove that siege of grief from her,<br />
               Betroth'd and would have married her perforce<br />
               To County Paris; then comes she to me,<br />
               And with wild looks bid me devise some means<br />
               To rid her from this second marriage,<br />
               Or in my cell there would she kill herself.<br />
               Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,<br />
               A sleeping potion, which so took effect<br />
               As I intended, for it wrought on her<br />
               The form of death; meantime I writ to Romeo<br />
               That he should hither come as this dire night,<br />
               To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,<br />
               Being the time the potion's force should cease.<br />
               But he which bore my letter, Friar John,<br />
               Was stay'd by accident and yesternight<br />
               Return'd my letter back. Then all alone,<br />
               At the prefixed hour of her waking,<br />
               Came I to take her from her kindred's vault,<br />
               Meaning to keep her closely at my cell<br />
               Till I conveniently could send to Romeo;<br />
               But when I came, some minute ere the time<br />
               Of her awaking, here untimely lay<br />
               The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.<br />
               She wakes, and I entreated her come forth<br />
               And bear this work of heaven with patience;<br />
               But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,<br />
               And she too desperate would not go with me,<br />
               But, as it seems, did violence on herself.<br />
               All this I know, and to the marriage<br />
               Her nurse is privy; and, if aught in this<br />
               Miscarried by my fault, let my old life<br />
               Be sacrific'd some hour before his time<br />
