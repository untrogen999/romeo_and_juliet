        <!-- AZ: Summary of the play -->
        <p>
            <i>The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,</i> or just <i>Romeo and Juliet,</i> is one of the most
            famous romances in the Western world which, as the name suggests, is a tragedy between the
            love of Romeo and Juliet. The two this play is named after lived in different houses who
            despise each other, <i>Montague</i> and <i>Capulet.</i> Romeo, belonging to the
            <i>Montague</i> house, attended a ball in the <i>Capulet</i> house in disguise to meet his
            crush, Rosaline. However, he then met and fell in love with Juliet, the daughter of the head
            of <i>Capulet.</i> When Juliet's cousin, Tybalt, discovered this, everything begins to
            escalate, eventually leading to the tragic deaths of both Romeo and Juliet and peace between
            the two houses.

        <!-- AZ: NOTE: This assumes two separate reading views were created. Paragraph needs to change if
            they're combined -->
        <p>The goal of this project is to analyze <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> by emphasizing certain aspects
            of the play and experimenting with how the play itself could be read. This was done through
            separate reading views, each with a different sub-goal. What this project accomplished so far
            was making a reading view focused on navigating between scenes and acts through a table of
            contents, and a reading view focused on emphasizing the gender and belonging house of each
            speaker of this play.
