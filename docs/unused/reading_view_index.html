      <p><span style="color: red;">Gregory: </span><span style="color: red;">Gregory: </span>To move is to stir, and to be valiant is <br />
 to stand; therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st <br />
 away  </p>

 weakest goes to the wall  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Sampson: </span><span style="color: red;">Sampson: </span>True; and therefore women, being the <br />
 weaker vessels, are ever thrust to the wall Therefore <br />
 <span class="term">I</span> will push Montague's men from the wall, and <br />
 thrust <span class="term">his</span> maids to the wall  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Gregory: </span><span style="color: red;">Gregory: </span>The quarrel is between our masters and <br />

 Profaners <span class="term">of</span> this <span class="term">neighbour-stained</span> steel,-- <br />
 Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts, <br />
 That quench the fire <span class="term">of</span> your pernicious rage <br />
 With purple fountains issuing from your veins, <br />
 On pain <span class="term">of</span> torture, from those bloody hands <br />
 Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground, <br />
 And hear the sentence <span class="term">of</span> your <span class="term">moved</span> prince -- <br />
 Three <span class="term">civil</span> brawls, bred <span class="term">of</span> an airy word, <br />
 By thee, <span class="term">old</span> Capulet, and Montague, <br />
 Have thrice disturb'd the quiet <span class="term">of</span> our streets, <br />
 And <span class="term">made</span> Verona's <span class="term">ancient</span> citizens <br />
 Cast by their <span class="term">grave</span> beseeming ornaments, <br />
 To wield <span class="term">old</span> partisans, <span class="term">in</span> hands <span class="term">as</span> old, <br />
 Canker'd <span class="term">with</span> peace, to part your canker'd hate  <br />
 If ever you disturb our streets again, <br />
 Your lives shall pay the forfeit <span class="term">of</span> the <span class="term">peace</span> -- <br />
 For this time, <span class="term">all</span> the rest <span class="term">depart</span> away -- <br />
 You, Capulet, shall go along <span class="term">with</span> me;-- <br />
 And, Montague, come you this afternoon, <br />
 To know our further pleasure <span class="term">in</span> this case, <br />
 To <span class="term">old</span> Freetown, our common judgment-place -- <br />
 Once more, on pain <span class="term">of</span> death, <span class="term">all</span> men <span class="term">depart</span>  <br />

      </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Montague: </span><span style="color: red;">Montague: </span>Who set this <span class="term">ancient</span> quarrel <span class="term">new</span> abroach? <br />
 Speak, nephew, were you by when it began? </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Benvolio: </span><span style="color: red;">Benvolio: </span>Here were the servants <span class="term">of</span> your adversary <br />
 And yours close fighting ere <span class="term">I</span> did approach  <br />
 <span class="term">I</span> drew to part them; <span class="term">in</span> the instant came <br />
 The fiery <span class="term">Tybalt</span> <span class="term">with</span> <span class="term">his</span> sword prepar'd, <br />
 Which, <span class="term">as</span> <span class="term">he</span> breath'd defiance to my ears, <br />
 He swung about <span class="term">his</span> head and cut the winds, <br />
 Who, <span class="term">nothing</span> hurt withal, hiss'd him <span class="term">in</span> scorn  <br />
 While we were interchanging thrusts and blows, <br />
 Came more and more, and fought on part and part, <br />
 Till the prince came, <span class="term">who</span> parted either part  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Lady Montague: </span><span style="color: red;">Lady Montague: </span>O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day? <br />
 Right glad <span class="term">I</span> am <span class="term">he</span> was not at this fray  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Benvolio: </span><span style="color: red;">Benvolio: </span>Madam, an <span class="term">hour</span> before the worshipp'd sun <br />
 Peer'd <span class="term">forth</span> the golden window <span class="term">of</span> the east, <br />
 A troubled mind drave <span class="term">me</span> to walk abroad; <br />
 Where, underneath the grove <span class="term">of</span> <span class="term">sycamore</span> <br />
 That westward rooteth from the city's side, <br />
 So early walking did <span class="term">I</span> see your son  <br />
 Towards him <span class="term">I</span> made, but <span class="term">he</span> was <span class="term">ware</span> <span class="term">of</span> <span class="term">me</span> <br />
 And stole into the covert <span class="term">of</span> the wood; <br />
 I, measuring <span class="term">his</span> <span class="term">affections</span> by my own, <br />
 Which then most sought where most might not be found, <br />
 Being one too many by my weary self, <br />
 Pursued my humour, not pursuing his, <br />
 And gladly shunn'd <span class="term">who</span> gladly fled from <span class="term">me</span>  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Montague: </span><span style="color: red;">Montague: </span>Many <span class="term">a</span> morning hath <span class="term">he</span> there been seen, <br />
 With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew, <br />
 Adding to clouds more clouds <span class="term">with</span> <span class="term">his</span> deep sighs; <br />
 But <span class="term">all</span> <span class="term">so</span> soon <span class="term">as</span> the all-cheering sun <br />
 Should <span class="term">in</span> the farthest east begin to draw <br />
 The shady curtains from Aurora's bed, <br />
 Away from <span class="term">light</span> steals home my <span class="term">heavy</span> son, <br />
 And private <span class="term">in</span> <span class="term">his</span> chamber pens himself, <br />
 Shuts <span class="term">up</span> <span class="term">his</span> windows, locks fair daylight out, <br />
 And makes himself an artificial night  <br />
 Black and portentous must this humour prove, <br />
 Unless good counsel may the cause remove  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Benvolio: </span><span style="color: red;">Benvolio: </span>My noble uncle, do you know the cause? </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Montague: </span><span style="color: red;">Montague: </span><span class="term">I</span> neither know it nor can <span class="term">learn</span> <span class="term">of</span> him  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Benvolio: </span><span style="color: red;">Benvolio: </span>Have you importun'd him by any means? </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Montague: </span><span style="color: red;">Montague: </span>Both by myself and many other friends; <br />
 But he, <span class="term">his</span> own affections' counsellor, <br />
 Is to himself--I will not say how true-- <br />
 But to himself <span class="term">so</span> secret and <span class="term">so</span> close, <br />
 So far from sounding and discovery, <br />
 As is the bud bit <span class="term">with</span> an <span class="term">envious</span> <span class="term">worm</span> <br />
 Ere <span class="term">he</span> can spread <span class="term">his</span> sweet <span class="term">leaves</span> to the air <br />
 Or dedicate <span class="term">his</span> beauty to the sun  <br />
 Could we but <span class="term">learn</span> from whence <span class="term">his</span> sorrows grow, <br />
 We would <span class="term">as</span> willingly give <span class="term">cure</span> <span class="term">as</span> know  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Benvolio: </span><span style="color: red;">Benvolio: </span>See, where <span class="term">he</span> comes! So please you, step aside; <br />
 I'll know <span class="term">his</span> grievance or be much denied  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Montague: </span><span style="color: red;">Montague: </span><span class="term">I</span> would thou wert <span class="term">so</span> happy by thy <span class="term">stay</span> <br />
 To hear true shrift --Come, madam, let's away  <br />

      <p><span style="color: red;">Benvolio: </span><span style="color: red;">Benvolio: </span>Of love? </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Romeo: </span><span style="color: red;">Romeo: </span>Out <span class="term">of</span> her favour where <span class="term">I</span> am <span class="term">in</span> <span class="term">love</span>  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Benvolio: </span><span style="color: red;">Benvolio: </span>Alas, <span class="term">that</span> love, <span class="term">so</span> gentle <span class="term">in</span> <span class="term">his</span> view, <br />
 Should be <span class="term">so</span> tyrannous and rough <span class="term">in</span> proof! </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Romeo: </span><span style="color: red;">Romeo: </span>Alas, <span class="term">that</span> love, whose <span class="term">view</span> is muffled still, <br />
 Should without eyes see pathways to <span class="term">his</span> will! <br />
 Where shall we dine?--O me! What fray was here? <br />
 Yet tell <span class="term">me</span> not, <span class="term">for</span> <span class="term">I</span> have heard it <span class="term">all</span>  <br />
 Here's much to do <span class="term">with</span> hate, but more <span class="term">with</span> <span class="term">love</span>  <br />
 Why, then, <span class="term">O</span> brawling love! <span class="term">O</span> loving hate! <br />
 <span class="term">O</span> any thing, <span class="term">of</span> <span class="term">nothing</span> first created! <br />
 <span class="term">O</span> <span class="term">heavy</span> lightness! serious vanity! <br />
 Misshapen chaos <span class="term">of</span> well-seeming forms! <br />
 Feather <span class="term">of</span> lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health! <br />

      <p><span style="color: red;">Benvolio: </span><span style="color: red;">Benvolio: </span>At thy good heart's oppression  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Romeo: </span><span style="color: red;">Romeo: </span>Why, such is love's transgression  <br />
 Griefs <span class="term">of</span> mine own lie <span class="term">heavy</span> <span class="term">in</span> my breast, <br />

 With more <span class="term">of</span> thine; this <span class="term">love</span> <span class="term">that</span> thou hast shown <br />
 Doth add more grief to too much <span class="term">of</span> mine own  <br />
 Love is <span class="term">a</span> smoke rais'd <span class="term">with</span> the fume <span class="term">of</span> sighs; <br />
 Being purg'd, <span class="term">a</span> fire sparkling <span class="term">in</span> lovers' eyes; <br />

 She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes <br />
 In shape no bigger than an agate-stone <br />
 On the fore-finger <span class="term">of</span> an alderman, <br />
 Drawn <span class="term">with</span> <span class="term">a</span> team <span class="term">of</span> little <span class="term">atomies</span> <br />
 Athwart men's noses <span class="term">as</span> they lie asleep; <br />
 Her waggon-spokes <span class="term">made</span> <span class="term">of</span> long spinners' legs, <br />
 The <span class="term">cover</span> <span class="term">of</span> the wings <span class="term">of</span> grasshoppers, <br />
 The traces <span class="term">of</span> the smallest spider's web, <br />
 The collars <span class="term">of</span> the moonshine's watery beams, <br />
 Her whip <span class="term">of</span> cricket's bone, the lash <span class="term">of</span> film, <br />
 Her waggoner <span class="term">a</span> small grey-coated gnat, <br />
 Not half <span class="term">so</span> big <span class="term">as</span> <span class="term">a</span> <span class="term">round</span> little <span class="term">worm</span> <br />
 Prick'd from the lazy finger <span class="term">of</span> <span class="term">a</span> maid; <br />
 Her chariot is an <span class="term">empty</span> hazel-nut <br />
 Made by the joiner squirrel or <span class="term">old</span> grub, <br />
 Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers  <br />
 And <span class="term">in</span> this state she gallops night by night <br />
 Through lover's brains, and then they dream <span class="term">of</span> love; <br />
 O'er courtiers' knees, <span class="term">that</span> dream on court'sies straight; <br />
 O'er lawyers' fingers, <span class="term">who</span> straight dream on fees; <br />
 O'er ladies' lips, <span class="term">who</span> straight on kisses dream, <br />
 Which oft the angry <span class="term">Mab</span> <span class="term">with</span> blisters plagues, <br />
 Because their breaths <span class="term">with</span> <span class="term">sweetmeats</span> tainted are  <br />
 Sometime she gallops o'er <span class="term">a</span> courtier's nose, <br />
 And then dreams <span class="term">he</span> <span class="term">of</span> smelling out <span class="term">a</span> suit; <br />
 And <span class="term">sometime</span> comes she <span class="term">with</span> <span class="term">a</span> tithe-pig's tail <br />
 Tickling <span class="term">a</span> parson's nose <span class="term">as</span> a' lies asleep, <br />
 Then dreams <span class="term">he</span> <span class="term">of</span> another benefice  <br />
 Sometime she driveth o'er <span class="term">a</span> soldier's neck, <br />
 And then dreams <span class="term">he</span> <span class="term">of</span> cutting foreign throats, <br />
 Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades, <br />
 Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon <br />
 Drums <span class="term">in</span> <span class="term">his</span> ear, at which <span class="term">he</span> starts and wakes, <br />
 And being thus frighted swears <span class="term">a</span> prayer or two <br />
 And sleeps again This is <span class="term">that</span> <span class="term">very</span> <span class="term">Mab</span> <br />
 That plats the manes <span class="term">of</span> horses <span class="term">in</span> the night, <br />
 And bakes the <span class="term">elf-locks</span> <span class="term">in</span> foul sluttish hairs, <br />
 Which once untangled much misfortune bodes  <br />
 This is she-- </p>

 Which is <span class="term">as</span> thin <span class="term">of</span> substance <span class="term">as</span> the air, <br />
 And more <span class="term">inconstant</span> than the wind, <span class="term">who</span> wooes <br />
 Even now the frozen bosom <span class="term">of</span> the North, <br />
 And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence, <br />

 Dost thou <span class="term">love</span> me? <span class="term">I</span> know thou wilt say ay, <br />

 Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries, <br />
 They say, Jove laughs <span class="term">O</span> gentle Romeo, <br />
 If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully; <br />
 Or if thou think'st <span class="term">I</span> am too quickly won, <br />
 I'll frown and be perverse and say thee nay, <br />
 So thou wilt woo, but else not <span class="term">for</span> the world  <br />
 In truth, fair Montague, <span class="term">I</span> am too fond, <br />
 And therefore thou mayst think my <span class="term">haviour</span> light; <br />
 But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true <br />
 Than those <span class="term">that</span> have more cunning to be <span class="term">strange</span>  <br />
 <span class="term">I</span> should have been more strange, <span class="term">I</span> must confess, <br />
 But <span class="term">that</span> thou overheard'st, ere <span class="term">I</span> was ware, <br />
 My true love's passion; therefore pardon me, <br />

      <h2>SCENE III. Friar Laurence's Cell</h2>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Friar Laurence: </span><span style="color: red;">Friar Laurence: </span>The <span class="term">grey-eyed</span> morn smiles on the frowning night, <br />
 Chequering the eastern clouds <span class="term">with</span> streaks <span class="term">of</span> light, <br />
 And <span class="term">flecked</span> darkness <span class="term">like</span> <span class="term">a</span> drunkard reels <br />
 From <span class="term">forth</span> day's path and Titan's fiery wheels  <br />
 Now, ere the sun advance <span class="term">his</span> burning eye, <br />
 The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry, <br />
 <span class="term">I</span> must up-fill this osier cage <span class="term">of</span> ours <br />
 With baleful <span class="term">weeds</span> and precious-juiced flowers  <br />
 The <span class="term">earth</span> that's nature's mother is her tomb; <br />
 What is her burying <span class="term">grave</span> <span class="term">that</span> is her womb, <br />
 And from her womb children <span class="term">of</span> divers kind <br />
 We sucking on her <span class="term">natural</span> bosom find, <br />
 Many <span class="term">for</span> many virtues excellent, <br />
 None but <span class="term">for</span> some, and yet <span class="term">all</span> different  <br />
 O, <span class="term">mickle</span> is the powerful grace <span class="term">that</span> lies <br />
 In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities! <br />
 For nought <span class="term">so</span> vile <span class="term">that</span> on the <span class="term">earth</span> <span class="term">doth</span> live <br />
 But to the <span class="term">earth</span> some special good <span class="term">doth</span> give; <br />
 Nor aught <span class="term">so</span> good but, strain'd from <span class="term">that</span> fair use, <br />
 Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse  <br />
 Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied, <br />
 And vice sometime's by action dignified  <br />
 Within the infant rind <span class="term">of</span> this weak flower <br />
 Poison hath residence, and medicine power; <br />
 For this, being smelt, <span class="term">with</span> <span class="term">that</span> part cheers each part, <br />
 Being tasted, slays <span class="term">all</span> senses <span class="term">with</span> the heart  <br />
 Two such opposed kings encamp them <span class="term">still</span> <br />
 In man <span class="term">as</span> <span class="term">well</span> <span class="term">as</span> herbs,--grace and rude will; <br />
 And where the <span class="term">worser</span> is predominant, <br />
 Full soon the <span class="term">canker</span> <span class="term">death</span> eats <span class="term">up</span> <span class="term">that</span> plant  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Romeo: </span><span style="color: red;">Romeo: </span>Good morrow, father  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Friar Laurence: </span><span style="color: red;">Friar Laurence: </span>Benedicite! <br />
 What early tongue <span class="term">so</span> sweet saluteth me?-- <br />
 Young son, it argues <span class="term">a</span> distemper'd head <br />
 So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed  <br />
 Care keeps <span class="term">his</span> watch <span class="term">in</span> every <span class="term">old</span> man's eye, <br />
 And where care lodges sleep will never lie; <br />
 But where unbruised youth <span class="term">with</span> unstuff'd brain <br />
 Doth couch <span class="term">his</span> limbs, there golden sleep <span class="term">doth</span> reign  <br />
 Therefore thy earliness <span class="term">doth</span> <span class="term">me</span> assure <br />
 Thou art up-rous'd <span class="term">with</span> some distemperature; <br />
 Or if not so, then here <span class="term">I</span> hit it right, <br />
 Our Romeo hath not been <span class="term">in</span> bed <span class="term">to-night</span>  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Romeo: </span><span style="color: red;">Romeo: </span>That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Friar Laurence: </span><span style="color: red;">Friar Laurence: </span>God pardon sin! wast thou <span class="term">with</span> Rosaline? </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Romeo: </span><span style="color: red;">Romeo: </span>With Rosaline, my <span class="term">ghostly</span> father? no; <br />
 <span class="term">I</span> have forgot <span class="term">that</span> name and <span class="term">that</span> name's woe  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Friar Laurence: </span><span style="color: red;">Friar Laurence: </span>That's my good son; but where <br />
 hast thou been, then? </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Romeo: </span><span style="color: red;">Romeo: </span><span class="term">I</span> 'll tell thee, ere thou ask it <span class="term">me</span> again  <br />
 <span class="term">I</span> have been feasting <span class="term">with</span> mine enemy, <br />
 Where on <span class="term">a</span> sudden one hath wounded <span class="term">me</span> <br />
 That's by <span class="term">me</span> wounded; both our remedies <br />
 Within thy help and holy physic lies  <br />
 <span class="term">I</span> bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo, <br />
 My intercession likewise <span class="term">steads</span> my foe  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Friar Laurence: </span><span style="color: red;">Friar Laurence: </span>Be plain, good son, and homely <span class="term">in</span> thy drift; <br />
 Riddling confession finds but <span class="term">riddling</span> shrift  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Romeo: </span><span style="color: red;">Romeo: </span>Then plainly know, my heart's <span class="term">dear</span> <span class="term">love</span> is set <br />
 On the fair daughter <span class="term">of</span> rich Capulet  <br />
 As mine on hers, <span class="term">so</span> hers is set on mine; <br />
 And <span class="term">all</span> combin'd, save <span class="term">what</span> thou must combine <br />
 By holy <span class="term">marriage</span> When and where and how <br />
 We met, we woo'd, and <span class="term">made</span> exchange <span class="term">of</span> vow, <br />
 I'll tell thee <span class="term">as</span> we pass; but this <span class="term">I</span> pray, <br />
 That thou consent to marry us to-day  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Friar Laurence: </span><span style="color: red;">Friar Laurence: </span>Holy Saint Francis, <span class="term">what</span> <span class="term">a</span> change is here! <br />
 Is Rosaline, <span class="term">that</span> thou didst <span class="term">love</span> <span class="term">so</span> dear, <br />
 So soon forsaken? young men's <span class="term">love</span> then lies <br />
 Not truly <span class="term">in</span> their hearts, but <span class="term">in</span> their eyes  <br />
 Jesu Maria, <span class="term">what</span> <span class="term">a</span> deal <span class="term">of</span> brine <br />
 Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks <span class="term">for</span> Rosaline! <br />
 How much salt water thrown away <span class="term">in</span> waste, <br />
 To <span class="term">season</span> <span class="term">love</span> <span class="term">that</span> <span class="term">of</span> it <span class="term">doth</span> not taste! <br />
 The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears, <br />
 Thy <span class="term">old</span> groans ring yet <span class="term">in</span> my <span class="term">ancient</span> ears; <br />
 Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain <span class="term">doth</span> sit <br />
 Of an <span class="term">old</span> tear <span class="term">that</span> is not wash'd off yet  <br />
 If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine, <br />
 Thou and these woes were <span class="term">all</span> <span class="term">for</span> Rosaline; <br />
 And art thou chang'd? pronounce this sentence then: <br />
 Women may fall when there's no strength <span class="term">in</span> men  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Romeo: </span><span style="color: red;">Romeo: </span>Thou chidd'st <span class="term">me</span> oft <span class="term">for</span> loving Rosaline  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Friar Laurence: </span><span style="color: red;">Friar Laurence: </span>For doting, not <span class="term">for</span> loving, pupil mine  </p>

 Thy <span class="term">love</span> did read by rote and could not spell  <br />
 But come, young waverer, come, go <span class="term">with</span> me, <br />
 In one respect I'll thy assistant be; <br />
 For this alliance may <span class="term">so</span> happy prove <br />
 To turn your households' rancour to pure <span class="term">love</span>  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Romeo: </span><span style="color: red;">Romeo: </span>O, <span class="term">let</span> us hence! <span class="term">I</span> stand on sudden haste  </p>

 Your high displeasure All this, uttered <br />
 With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd, <br />
 Could not take truce <span class="term">with</span> the unruly <span class="term">spleen</span> <br />
 Of <span class="term">Tybalt</span> deaf to peace, but <span class="term">that</span> <span class="term">he</span> tilts <br />
 With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast, <br />
 Who, <span class="term">all</span> <span class="term">as</span> hot, turns deadly point to point, <br />
 And, <span class="term">with</span> <span class="term">a</span> martial scorn, <span class="term">with</span> one hand beats <br />
 Cold <span class="term">death</span> aside, and <span class="term">with</span> the other sends <br />
 It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity <br />
 Retorts it Romeo <span class="term">he</span> cries aloud, <br />
 'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and swifter than <span class="term">his</span> tongue, <br />
 His agile arm beats down their fatal points, <br />
 And 'twixt them rushes, underneath whose arm <br />
 An <span class="term">envious</span> thrust from <span class="term">Tybalt</span> hit the life <br />
 Of stout Mercutio; and then <span class="term">Tybalt</span> fled, <br />
 But by and by comes back to Romeo, <br />
 Who had but newly entertain'd revenge, <br />
 And to 't they go <span class="term">like</span> lightning, for, ere <span class="term">I</span> <br />

 And bring <span class="term">in</span> cloudy night immediately -- <br />
 Spread thy close curtain, love-performing Night, <br />
 That runaways' eyes may wink, and Romeo <br />
 Leap to these arms, untalk'd <span class="term">of</span> and unseen -- <br />
 Lovers can see to do their amorous rites <br />
 By their own beauties; or, if <span class="term">love</span> be blind, <br />
 It best agrees <span class="term">with</span> night --Come, <span class="term">civil</span> Night, <br />

 Give <span class="term">me</span> my Romeo; and, when <span class="term">he</span> shall die, <br />
 Take him and cut him out <span class="term">in</span> little stars, <br />

 Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb! <br />

 When thou didst bower the spirit <span class="term">of</span> <span class="term">a</span> fiend <br />
 In mortal paradise <span class="term">of</span> such sweet flesh? <br />
 Was ever book containing such vile matter <br />

 But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin? <br />
 That villain <span class="term">cousin</span> would have kill'd my husband  <br />

      <h2>SCENE III. Friar Laurence's Cell</h2>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Friar Laurence: </span><span style="color: red;">Friar Laurence: </span>Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou <span class="term">fearful</span> man  <br />
 Affliction is enamour'd <span class="term">of</span> thy parts, <br />
 And thou art wedded to calamity  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Romeo: </span><span style="color: red;">Romeo: </span>Father, <span class="term">what</span> news? <span class="term">what</span> is the prince's doom? <br />
 What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand, <br />
 That <span class="term">I</span> yet know not? </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Friar Laurence: </span><span style="color: red;">Friar Laurence: </span>Too <span class="term">familiar</span> <br />
 Is my <span class="term">dear</span> son <span class="term">with</span> such <span class="term">sour</span> company; <br />
 <span class="term">I</span> bring thee <span class="term">tidings</span> <span class="term">of</span> the prince's doom  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Romeo: </span><span style="color: red;">Romeo: </span>What less than doomsday is the prince's doom? </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Friar Laurence: </span><span style="color: red;">Friar Laurence: </span>A gentler judgment vanish'd from <span class="term">his</span> lips, <br />
 Not body's death, but body's banishment  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Romeo: </span><span style="color: red;">Romeo: </span>Ha, banishment! be merciful, say death, <br />
 For <span class="term">exile</span> hath more terror <span class="term">in</span> <span class="term">his</span> look, <br />
 Much more than death; do not say banishment  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Friar Laurence: </span><span style="color: red;">Friar Laurence: </span>Hence from <span class="term">Verona</span> art thou banished; <br />
 Be patient, <span class="term">for</span> the world is <span class="term">broad</span> and wide  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Romeo: </span><span style="color: red;">Romeo: </span>There is no world without <span class="term">Verona</span> walls, <br />
 But purgatory, torture, hell itself  <br />
 Hence banished is banish'd from the world, <br />
 And world's <span class="term">exile</span> is <span class="term">death</span> Then banished <br />
 Is <span class="term">death</span> misterm'd; calling <span class="term">death</span> banishment <br />
 Thou cutt'st my head off <span class="term">with</span> <span class="term">a</span> golden axe, <br />
 And smil'st upon the stroke <span class="term">that</span> murthers <span class="term">me</span>  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Friar Laurence: </span><span style="color: red;">Friar Laurence: </span><span class="term">O</span> deadly sin! <span class="term">O</span> rude unthankfulness! <br />
 Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince, <br />
 Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law, <br />
 And turn'd <span class="term">that</span> black word <span class="term">death</span> to banishment  <br />
 This is <span class="term">dear</span> mercy, and thou seest it not  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Romeo: </span><span style="color: red;">Romeo: </span>'Tis torture, and not mercy; heaven is here, <br />
 Where Juliet lives, and every cat and dog <br />
 And little mouse, every unworthy thing, <br />
 Live here <span class="term">in</span> heaven and may look on her, <br />
 But Romeo may not More validity, <br />
 More honourable state, more <span class="term">courtship</span> lives <br />
 In carrion-flies than Romeo They may seize <br />
 On the white wonder <span class="term">of</span> <span class="term">dear</span> Juliet's hand <br />
 And steal immortal blessing from her lips, <br />
 Who, even <span class="term">in</span> pure and vestal modesty, <br />
 Still blush, <span class="term">as</span> thinking their own kisses sin; <br />
 But Romeo may not, <span class="term">he</span> is banished  <br />
 This may flies do, when <span class="term">I</span> from this must fly; <br />
 They are free men, but <span class="term">I</span> am banished  <br />
 And say'st thou yet <span class="term">that</span> <span class="term">exile</span> is not death? <br />
 Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife, <br />
 No sudden <span class="term">mean</span> <span class="term">of</span> death, though ne'er <span class="term">so</span> mean, <br />
 But 'banished' to kill me?--Banished! <br />
 <span class="term">O</span> friar, the damned <span class="term">use</span> <span class="term">that</span> word <span class="term">in</span> hell, <br />
 Howling attends it; how hast thou the heart, <br />
 Being <span class="term">a</span> divine, <span class="term">a</span> <span class="term">ghostly</span> confessor, <br />
 A sin-absolver, and my <span class="term">friend</span> profess'd, <br />
 To mangle <span class="term">me</span> <span class="term">with</span> <span class="term">that</span> word 'banished'? </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Friar Laurence: </span><span style="color: red;">Friar Laurence: </span>Thou <span class="term">fond</span> mad man, hear <span class="term">me</span> but speak <span class="term">a</span> word  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Romeo: </span><span style="color: red;">Romeo: </span>O, thou wilt speak again <span class="term">of</span> banishment  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Friar Laurence: </span><span style="color: red;">Friar Laurence: </span>I'll give thee armour to keep off <span class="term">that</span> word; <br />
 Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy, <br />
 To comfort thee, though thou art banished  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Romeo: </span><span style="color: red;">Romeo: </span>Yet 'banished'? Hang <span class="term">up</span> philosophy! <br />
 Unless philosophy can make <span class="term">a</span> Juliet, <br />
 Displant <span class="term">a</span> town, reverse <span class="term">a</span> prince's doom, <br />
 It helps not, it <span class="term">prevails</span> not; talk no more  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Friar Laurence: </span><span style="color: red;">Friar Laurence: </span>O, then <span class="term">I</span> see <span class="term">that</span> madmen have no ears  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Romeo: </span><span style="color: red;">Romeo: </span>How should they, when <span class="term">that</span> wise men have no eyes? </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Friar Laurence: </span><span style="color: red;">Friar Laurence: </span>Let <span class="term">me</span> <span class="term">dispute</span> <span class="term">with</span> thee <span class="term">of</span> thy estate  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Romeo: </span><span style="color: red;">Romeo: </span>Thou canst not speak <span class="term">of</span> <span class="term">that</span> thou dost not feel  <br />

 Doting <span class="term">like</span> <span class="term">me</span> and <span class="term">like</span> <span class="term">me</span> banished, <br />
 Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair, <br />
 And fall upon the ground, <span class="term">as</span> <span class="term">I</span> do now, <br />

 Art thou <span class="term">a</span> man? thy <span class="term">form</span> cries out thou art; <br />
 Thy tears are womanish, thy wild acts denote <br />
 The unreasonable fury <span class="term">of</span> <span class="term">a</span> beast  <br />
 Unseemly woman <span class="term">in</span> <span class="term">a</span> seeming man! <br />
 Or <span class="term">ill-beseeming</span> beast <span class="term">in</span> seeming both! <br />
 Thou hast amaz'd me; by my holy order, <br />
 <span class="term">I</span> <span class="term">thought</span> thy disposition better temper'd  <br />
 Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself? <br />
 And slay thy lady too <span class="term">that</span> lives <span class="term">in</span> thee, <br />
 By doing damned hate upon thyself? <br />
 Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth? <br />
 Since birth and heaven and earth, <span class="term">all</span> three do meet <br />
 In thee at once, which thou at once wouldst lose  <br />
 Fie, fie, thou sham'st thy shape, thy love, thy wit, <br />
 Which, <span class="term">like</span> <span class="term">a</span> usurer, abound'st <span class="term">in</span> all, <br />
 And usest none <span class="term">in</span> <span class="term">that</span> true <span class="term">use</span> indeed <br />
 Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy <span class="term">wit</span>  <br />
 Thy noble shape is but <span class="term">a</span> <span class="term">form</span> <span class="term">of</span> wax, <br />
 Digressing from the valour <span class="term">of</span> <span class="term">a</span> man; <br />
 Thy <span class="term">dear</span> <span class="term">love</span> sworn, but hollow perjury, <br />
 Killing <span class="term">that</span> <span class="term">love</span> which thou hast vow'd to cherish; <br />
 Thy wit, <span class="term">that</span> ornament to shape and love, <br />
 Misshapen <span class="term">in</span> the <span class="term">conduct</span> <span class="term">of</span> them both, <br />
 Like powder <span class="term">in</span> <span class="term">a</span> skilless soldier's flask, <br />
 Is set a-fire by thine own ignorance, <br />
 And thou dismember'd <span class="term">with</span> thine own defence  <br />
 What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive, <br />
 For whose <span class="term">dear</span> sake thou wast but lately dead; <br />
 There art thou happy <span class="term">Tybalt</span> would kill thee, <br />
 But thou slew'st Tybalt; there art thou happy too  <br />
 The law <span class="term">that</span> threaten'd <span class="term">death</span> becomes thy <span class="term">friend</span> <br />
 And turns it to exile; there art thou happy  <br />
 A pack <span class="term">of</span> blessings lights upon thy back, <br />
 Happiness courts thee <span class="term">in</span> her best array; <br />
 But, <span class="term">like</span> <span class="term">a</span> misbehav'd and sullen wench, <br />
 Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy <span class="term">love</span>  <br />
 Take heed, take heed, <span class="term">for</span> such die miserable  <br />
 Go, get thee to thy love, <span class="term">as</span> was decreed, <br />
 Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her; <br />
 But look thou <span class="term">stay</span> not till the watch be set, <br />
 For then thou canst not pass to Mantua, <br />
 Where thou shalt live till we can find <span class="term">a</span> time <br />
 To <span class="term">blaze</span> your marriage, reconcile your friends, <br />
 Beg pardon <span class="term">of</span> the prince, and call thee back <br />
 With twenty hundred thousand times more joy <br />
 Than thou went'st <span class="term">forth</span> <span class="term">in</span> <span class="term">lamentation</span> -- <br />
 Go before, nurse, commend <span class="term">me</span> to thy lady, <br />
 And bid her hasten <span class="term">all</span> the <span class="term">house</span> to bed, <br />
 Which <span class="term">heavy</span> sorrow makes them apt unto; <br />

      <h2>SCENE V. Juliet's Chamber</h2>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Juliet: </span><span style="color: red;">Juliet: </span>Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day  <br />
 It was the nightingale, and not the lark, <br />
 That pierc'd the <span class="term">fearful</span> hollow <span class="term">of</span> thine ear; <br />
 Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree  <br />
 Believe me, love, it was the nightingale  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Romeo: </span><span style="color: red;">Romeo: </span>It was the lark, the herald <span class="term">of</span> the morn, <br />
 No nightingale; look, love, <span class="term">what</span> <span class="term">envious</span> streaks <br />
 Do <span class="term">lace</span> the severing clouds <span class="term">in</span> yonder east  <br />
 Night's <span class="term">candles</span> are burnt out, and jocund day <br />
 Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops  <br />
 <span class="term">I</span> must be gone and live, or <span class="term">stay</span> and die  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Juliet: </span><span style="color: red;">Juliet: </span>Yon <span class="term">light</span> is not daylight, <span class="term">I</span> know it, <span class="term">I</span>  <br />
 It is some meteor <span class="term">that</span> the sun exhales, <br />
 To be to thee this night <span class="term">a</span> <span class="term">torch-bearer</span> <br />
 And <span class="term">light</span> thee on thy way to Mantua; <br />
 Therefore <span class="term">stay</span> yet, thou need'st not to be gone  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Romeo: </span><span style="color: red;">Romeo: </span>Let <span class="term">me</span> be ta'en, <span class="term">let</span> <span class="term">me</span> be put to death; <br />
 <span class="term">I</span> am content, <span class="term">so</span> thou wilt have it <span class="term">so</span>  <br />
 I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye, <br />
 'Tis but the pale reflex <span class="term">of</span> Cynthia's brow; <br />
 Nor <span class="term">that</span> is not the lark, whose notes do beat <br />
 The <span class="term">vaulty</span> heaven <span class="term">so</span> high above our heads  <br />
 <span class="term">I</span> have more care to <span class="term">stay</span> than will to go; <br />
 Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it <span class="term">so</span>  <br />
 How is 't, my soul? let's talk, it is not day  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Juliet: </span><span style="color: red;">Juliet: </span>It is, it is; hie hence, be gone, away! <br />
 It is the lark <span class="term">that</span> sings <span class="term">so</span> out <span class="term">of</span> tune, <br />
 Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps  <br />
 Some say the lark makes sweet division; <br />
 This <span class="term">doth</span> not so, <span class="term">for</span> she divideth us  <br />
 Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes; <br />
 O, now <span class="term">I</span> would they had chang'd voices too! <br />
 Since arm from arm <span class="term">that</span> voice <span class="term">doth</span> us affray, <br />
 Hunting thee hence <span class="term">with</span> hunt's-up to the day  <br />
 O, now be gone; more <span class="term">light</span> and <span class="term">light</span> it grows  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Romeo: </span><span style="color: red;">Romeo: </span>More <span class="term">light</span> and light?--More dark and <br />

      <h1>ACT IV</h1>
      <h2>SCENE I. Friar Laurence's Cell</h2>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Friar Laurence: </span><span style="color: red;">Friar Laurence: </span>On Thursday, sir? the time is <span class="term">very</span> short  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Paris: </span><span style="color: red;">Paris: </span>My father Capulet will have it so, <br />
 And <span class="term">I</span> am <span class="term">nothing</span> <span class="term">slow</span> to slack <span class="term">his</span> haste  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Friar Laurence: </span><span style="color: red;">Friar Laurence: </span>You say you do not know the lady's mind; <br />
 Uneven is the course, <span class="term">I</span> <span class="term">like</span> it not  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Paris: </span><span style="color: red;">Paris: </span>Immoderately she weeps <span class="term">for</span> Tybalt's death, <br />
 And therefore have <span class="term">I</span> little talk'd <span class="term">of</span> love; <br />
 For Venus smiles not <span class="term">in</span> <span class="term">a</span> <span class="term">house</span> <span class="term">of</span> tears  <br />
 Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous <br />
 That she <span class="term">doth</span> give her sorrow <span class="term">so</span> much sway, <br />
 And <span class="term">in</span> <span class="term">his</span> wisdom hastes our marriage, <br />
 To stop the inundation <span class="term">of</span> her tears, <br />
 Which, too much minded by herself alone, <br />
 May be put from her by society  <br />
 Now do you know the reason <span class="term">of</span> this haste  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Friar Laurence: </span><span style="color: red;">Friar Laurence: </span><stagedirection xmlns="">Aside</stagedirection> <span class="term">I</span> would <span class="term">I</span> knew not why it should be slow'd -- <br />
 Look, sir, here comes the lady <span class="term">towards</span> my cell  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Paris: </span><span style="color: red;">Paris: </span>Happily met, my lady and my wife! </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Juliet: </span><span style="color: red;">Juliet: </span>That may be, sir, when <span class="term">I</span> may be <span class="term">a</span> wife  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Paris: </span><span style="color: red;">Paris: </span>That may be must be, love, on Thursday next  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Juliet: </span><span style="color: red;">Juliet: </span>What must be shall be  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Friar Laurence: </span><span style="color: red;">Friar Laurence: </span>That's <span class="term">a</span> certain text  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Paris: </span><span style="color: red;">Paris: </span>Come you to make confession to this father? </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Juliet: </span><span style="color: red;">Juliet: </span>To answer that, <span class="term">I</span> should confess to you  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Paris: </span><span style="color: red;">Paris: </span>Do not <span class="term">deny</span> to him <span class="term">that</span> you <span class="term">love</span> <span class="term">me</span>  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Juliet: </span><span style="color: red;">Juliet: </span><span class="term">I</span> will confess to you <span class="term">that</span> <span class="term">I</span> <span class="term">love</span> him  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Paris: </span><span style="color: red;">Paris: </span>So will you, <span class="term">I</span> am sure, <span class="term">that</span> you <span class="term">love</span> <span class="term">me</span>  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Juliet: </span><span style="color: red;">Juliet: </span>If <span class="term">I</span> do so, it will be <span class="term">of</span> more price, <br />
 Being spoke behind your back, than to your face  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Paris: </span><span style="color: red;">Paris: </span> Poor soul, thy face is much abus'd <span class="term">with</span> tears  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Juliet: </span><span style="color: red;">Juliet: </span>The tears have got small victory by that, <br />
 For it was bad enough before their <span class="term">spite</span>  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Paris: </span><span style="color: red;">Paris: </span>Thou wrong'st it more than tears <span class="term">with</span> <span class="term">that</span> report  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Juliet: </span><span style="color: red;">Juliet: </span>That is no slander, sir, which is <span class="term">a</span> truth; <br />
 And <span class="term">what</span> <span class="term">I</span> spake, <span class="term">I</span> spake it to my face  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Paris: </span><span style="color: red;">Paris: </span>Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Juliet: </span><span style="color: red;">Juliet: </span>It may be so, <span class="term">for</span> it is not mine own -- <br />
 Are you at leisure, holy father, now, <br />
 Or shall <span class="term">I</span> come to you at evening mass? </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Friar Laurence: </span><span style="color: red;">Friar Laurence: </span>My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now -- <br />
 My lord, we must entreat the time alone  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Paris: </span><span style="color: red;">Paris: </span>God shield <span class="term">I</span> should disturb devotion!-- <br />
 Juliet, on Thursday early will <span class="term">I</span> rouse ye; <br />
 Till then, adieu, and keep this holy kiss

      </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Juliet: </span><span style="color: red;">Juliet: </span>O, shut the door! and when thou hast done so, <br />
 Come weep <span class="term">with</span> me; past hope, past cure, past help! </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Friar Laurence: </span><span style="color: red;">Friar Laurence: </span>Ah, Juliet, <span class="term">I</span> already know thy grief; <br />
 It strains <span class="term">me</span> past the compass <span class="term">of</span> my wits  <br />
 <span class="term">I</span> hear thou must, and <span class="term">nothing</span> may prorogue it, <br />
 On Thursday next be <span class="term">married</span> to this <span class="term">county</span>  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Juliet: </span><span style="color: red;">Juliet: </span>Tell <span class="term">me</span> not, friar, <span class="term">that</span> thou hear'st <span class="term">of</span> this, <br />
 Unless thou tell <span class="term">me</span> how <span class="term">I</span> may prevent it; <br />
 If <span class="term">in</span> thy wisdom thou canst give no help, <br />
 Do thou but call my resolution wise, <br />
 And <span class="term">with</span> this <span class="term">knife</span> I'll help it <span class="term">presently</span>  <br />
 God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands; <br />
 And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd, <br />
 Shall be the <span class="term">label</span> to another deed, <br />
 Or my true heart <span class="term">with</span> treacherous revolt <br />
 Turn to another, this shall slay them both  <br />
 Therefore, out <span class="term">of</span> thy long-experienc'd time, <br />
 Give <span class="term">me</span> some <span class="term">present</span> counsel, or, behold, <br />
 'Twixt my <span class="term">extremes</span> and <span class="term">me</span> this bloody <span class="term">knife</span> <br />
 Shall play the umpire, arbitrating <span class="term">that</span> <br />
 Which the <span class="term">commission</span> <span class="term">of</span> thy years and art <br />
 Could to no issue <span class="term">of</span> true honour bring  <br />
 Be not <span class="term">so</span> long to speak; <span class="term">I</span> long to die, <br />
 If <span class="term">what</span> thou speak'st speak not <span class="term">of</span> remedy  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Friar Laurence: </span><span style="color: red;">Friar Laurence: </span>Hold, daughter! <span class="term">I</span> do spy <span class="term">a</span> kind <span class="term">of</span> hope, <br />
 Which craves <span class="term">as</span> <span class="term">desperate</span> an execution <br />
 As <span class="term">that</span> is <span class="term">desperate</span> which we would prevent  <br />
 If, rather than to marry County Paris, <br />
 Thou hast the strength <span class="term">of</span> will to slay thyself, <br />
 Then is it likely thou wilt undertake <br />
 A thing <span class="term">like</span> <span class="term">death</span> to chide away this shame <br />
 That cop'st <span class="term">with</span> <span class="term">death</span> himself to <span class="term">scape</span> from it; <br />
 And, if thou dar'st, I'll give thee remedy  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Juliet: </span><span style="color: red;">Juliet: </span>O, bid <span class="term">me</span> leap, rather than marry Paris, <br />
 From off the battlements <span class="term">of</span> yonder tower; <br />
 Or walk <span class="term">in</span> thievish ways; or bid <span class="term">me</span> lurk <br />
 Where serpents are; chain <span class="term">me</span> <span class="term">with</span> roaring bears; <br />
 Or shut <span class="term">me</span> nightly <span class="term">in</span> <span class="term">a</span> charnel-house, <br />
 O'er-cover'd quite <span class="term">with</span> dead men's rattling bones, <br />
 With <span class="term">reeky</span> shanks and yellow chapless skulls; <br />
 Or bid <span class="term">me</span> go into <span class="term">a</span> new-made <span class="term">grave</span> <br />
 And hide <span class="term">me</span> <span class="term">with</span> <span class="term">a</span> dead man <span class="term">in</span> <span class="term">his</span> shroud,-- <br />
 Things, <span class="term">that</span> to hear them told, have <span class="term">made</span> <span class="term">me</span> tremble,-- <br />
 And <span class="term">I</span> will do it without fear or doubt, <br />
 To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet <span class="term">love</span>  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Friar Laurence: </span><span style="color: red;">Friar Laurence: </span>Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent <br />
 To marry Paris Wednesday is to-morrow  <br />
 To-morrow night look <span class="term">that</span> thou lie alone; <br />
 Let not thy nurse lie <span class="term">with</span> thee <span class="term">in</span> thy chamber  <br />
 Take thou this vial, being then <span class="term">in</span> bed, <br />
 And this distilled liquor drink thou off; <br />
 When <span class="term">presently</span> through <span class="term">all</span> thy veins shall run <br />
 A cold and drowsy humour, <span class="term">for</span> no pulse <br />
 Shall keep <span class="term">his</span> native progress but <span class="term">surcease</span>  <br />
 No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest; <br />
 The roses <span class="term">in</span> thy lips and cheeks shall fade <br />
 To <span class="term">paly</span> ashes, thy eyes' windows fall, <br />
 Like death, when <span class="term">he</span> shuts <span class="term">up</span> the day <span class="term">of</span> life; <br />
 Each part, depriv'd <span class="term">of</span> supple government, <br />
 Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear <span class="term">like</span> death; <br />
 And <span class="term">in</span> this borrow'd likeness <span class="term">of</span> shrunk <span class="term">death</span> <br />
 Thou shalt continue two and forty hours, <br />
 And then awake <span class="term">as</span> from <span class="term">a</span> pleasant sleep  <br />
 Now, when the bridegroom <span class="term">in</span> the morning comes <br />
 To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead  <br />
 Then, <span class="term">as</span> the manner <span class="term">of</span> our country is, <br />
 In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier <br />
 Thou shalt be borne to <span class="term">that</span> same <span class="term">ancient</span> vault <br />
 Where <span class="term">all</span> the kindred <span class="term">of</span> the Capulets lie  <br />
 In the <span class="term">mean</span> time, <span class="term">against</span> thou shalt awake, <br />
 Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift, <br />
 And hither shall <span class="term">he</span> come; and <span class="term">he</span> and <span class="term">I</span> <br />
 Will watch thy waking, and <span class="term">that</span> <span class="term">very</span> night <br />
 Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua  <br />
 And this shall free thee from this <span class="term">present</span> shame, <br />
 If no <span class="term">inconstant</span> <span class="term">toy</span> nor womanish fear <br />
 Abate thy valour <span class="term">in</span> the acting it  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Juliet: </span><span style="color: red;">Juliet: </span>Give me, give me! O, tell not <span class="term">me</span> <span class="term">of</span> fear! </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Friar Laurence: </span><span style="color: red;">Friar Laurence: </span>Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous <br />
 In this resolve I'll send <span class="term">a</span> friar <span class="term">with</span> speed <br />
 To Mantua, <span class="term">with</span> my letters to thy lord  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Juliet: </span><span style="color: red;">Juliet: </span>Love give <span class="term">me</span> strength! and strength shall help afford  <br />

 Sharp misery had worn him to the bones; <br />

 An <span class="term">alligator</span> stuff'd, and other skins <br />
 Of ill-shap'd fishes; and about <span class="term">his</span> shelves <br />
 A beggarly account <span class="term">of</span> <span class="term">empty</span> boxes, <br />
 Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds, <br />
 Remnants <span class="term">of</span> packthread and <span class="term">old</span> cakes <span class="term">of</span> roses, <br />
 Were thinly scatter'd, to make <span class="term">up</span> <span class="term">a</span> show  <br />

 Was Tybalt's doomsday, whose <span class="term">untimely</span> <span class="term">death</span> <br />
 Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from this city, <br />
 For whom, and not <span class="term">for</span> Tybalt, Juliet pin'd  <br />
 You, to remove <span class="term">that</span> <span class="term">siege</span> <span class="term">of</span> grief from her, <br />
 Betroth'd and would have <span class="term">married</span> her <span class="term">perforce</span> <br />
 To County Paris; then comes she to me, <br />
 And <span class="term">with</span> wild looks bid <span class="term">me</span> devise some means <br />
 To rid her from this second marriage, <br />
 Or <span class="term">in</span> my cell there would she kill herself  <br />
 Then gave <span class="term">I</span> her, <span class="term">so</span> tutor'd by my art, <br />
 A sleeping potion, which <span class="term">so</span> took effect <br />
 As <span class="term">I</span> intended, <span class="term">for</span> it <span class="term">wrought</span> on her <br />
 The <span class="term">form</span> <span class="term">of</span> death; meantime <span class="term">I</span> writ to Romeo <br />
 That <span class="term">he</span> should hither come <span class="term">as</span> this dire night, <br />
 To help to take her from her borrow'd grave, <br />
 Being the time the potion's force should cease  <br />
 But <span class="term">he</span> which bore my letter, Friar John, <br />
 Was stay'd by accident and yesternight <br />
 Return'd my letter back Then <span class="term">all</span> alone, <br />
 At the prefixed <span class="term">hour</span> <span class="term">of</span> her waking, <br />
 Came <span class="term">I</span> to take her from her kindred's vault, <br />
 Meaning to keep her closely at my cell <br />
 Till <span class="term">I</span> conveniently could send to Romeo; <br />
 But when <span class="term">I</span> came, some minute ere the time <br />
 Of her awaking, here <span class="term">untimely</span> <span class="term">lay</span> <br />
 The noble Paris and true Romeo dead  <br />
 She wakes, and <span class="term">I</span> entreated her come <span class="term">forth</span> <br />
 And bear this work <span class="term">of</span> heaven <span class="term">with</span> patience; <br />
 But then <span class="term">a</span> noise did scare <span class="term">me</span> from the tomb, <br />
 And she too <span class="term">desperate</span> would not go <span class="term">with</span> me, <br />
 But, <span class="term">as</span> it seems, did violence on herself  <br />
 All this <span class="term">I</span> know, and to the <span class="term">marriage</span> <br />
 Her nurse is privy; and, if aught <span class="term">in</span> this <br />
 Miscarried by my fault, <span class="term">let</span> my <span class="term">old</span> life <br />
 Be sacrific'd some <span class="term">hour</span> before <span class="term">his</span> time <br />
 Unto the rigour <span class="term">of</span> severest law  </p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Prince: </span><span style="color: red;">Prince: </span>We <span class="term">still</span> have known thee <span class="term">for</span> <span class="term">a</span> holy man -- <br />

 To this same place, to this same monument  <br />
 This letter <span class="term">he</span> early bid <span class="term">me</span> give <span class="term">his</span> father, <br />
 And threaten'd <span class="term">me</span> <span class="term">with</span> death, going <span class="term">in</span> the vault, <br />

 Anon comes one <span class="term">with</span> <span class="term">light</span> to ope the tomb, <br />
 And by and by my master drew on him; <br />
 And then <span class="term">I</span> ran away to call the watch  </p>

 Of <span class="term">a</span> poor pothecary, and <span class="term">therewithal</span> <br />
 Came to this vault to die and lie <span class="term">with</span> Juliet -- <br />
 Where be these enemies?--Capulet!--Montague! <br />
