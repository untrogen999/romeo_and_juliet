       Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,<br/>
       By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,<br/>
       Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,<br/>
       And made Verona's ancient citizens<br/>
       Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,<br/>
       To wield old partisans, in hands as old,<br/>
       Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate.<br/>

       Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.--<br/>

       And yours close fighting ere I did approach.<br/>
       I drew to part them; in the instant came<br/>
       The fiery Tybalt with his sword prepar'd,<br/>
       Which, as he breath'd defiance to my ears,<br/>
       He swung about his head and cut the winds,<br/>
       Who, nothing hurt withal, hiss'd him in scorn.<br/>
       While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,<br/>
       Came more and more, and fought on part and part,<br/>

       Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,<br/>
       A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;<br/>
       Where, underneath the grove of sycamore<br/>
       That westward rooteth from the city's side,<br/>
       So early walking did I see your son.<br/>
       Towards him I made, but he was ware of me<br/>
       And stole into the covert of the wood;<br/>
       I, measuring his affections by my own,<br/>
       Which then most sought where most might not be found,<br/>
       Being one too many by my weary self,<br/>
       Pursued my humour, not pursuing his,<br/>
       And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.</speech>
       
       <speech><speaker char="Montague" sex="M" house="M">Montague</speaker>Many a morning hath he there been seen,<br/>
       With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew,<br/>
       Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;<br/>
       But all so soon as the all-cheering sun<br/>
       Should in the farthest east begin to draw<br/>
       The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,<br/>
       Away from light steals home my heavy son,<br/>
       And private in his chamber pens himself,<br/>
       Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out,<br/>
       And makes himself an artificial night.<br/>
       Black and portentous must this humour prove,<br/>
       Unless good counsel may the cause remove.</speech>
       
       <speech><speaker char="Benvolio" sex="M" house="M">Benvolio</speaker>My noble uncle, do you know the cause?</speech>

       But he, his own affections' counsellor,<br/>
       Is to himself--I will not say how true--<br/>
       But to himself so secret and so close,<br/>
       So far from sounding and discovery,<br/>
       As is the bud bit with an envious worm<br/>
       Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air<br/>
       Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.<br/>
       Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,<br/>
       We would as willingly give cure as know.</speech>

       Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.<br/>
       Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.<br/>
       Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!<br/>
       O any thing, of nothing first created!<br/>
       O heavy lightness! serious vanity!<br/>
       Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!<br/>
       Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!<br/>

       Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,<br/>
       Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest<br/>
       With more of thine; this love that thou hast shown<br/>
       Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.<br/>
       Love is a smoke rais'd with the fume of sighs;<br/>
       Being purg'd, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;<br/>
       Being vex'd, a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears.<br/>
       What is it else? a madness most discreet,<br/>
       A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.<br/>

       For beauty starv'd with her severity<br/>
       Cuts beauty off from all posterity.<br/>
       She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,<br/>
       To merit bliss by making me despair;<br/>
       She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow<br/>

      She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes<br/>
      In shape no bigger than an agate-stone<br/>
      On the fore-finger of an alderman,<br/>
      Drawn with a team of little atomies<br/>
      Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;<br/>
      Her waggon-spokes made of long spinners' legs,<br/>
      The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,<br/>
      The traces of the smallest spider's web,<br/>
      The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,<br/>
      Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,<br/>
      Her waggoner a small grey-coated gnat,<br/>
      Not half so big as a round little worm<br/>
      Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;<br/>
      Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut<br/>
      Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,<br/>
      Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.<br/>
      And in this state she gallops night by night<br/>
      Through lover's brains, and then they dream of love;<br/>
      O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight;<br/>
      O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees;<br/>
      O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream,<br/>
      Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,<br/>
      Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.<br/>
      Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,<br/>
      And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;<br/>
      And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail<br/>
      Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,<br/>
      Then dreams he of another benefice.<br/>
      Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,<br/>
      And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,<br/>
      Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,<br/>
      Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon<br/>
      Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,<br/>
      And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two<br/>
      And sleeps again. This is that very Mab<br/>
      That plats the manes of horses in the night,<br/>

      Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;<br/>
      And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife.<br/>
      I married them; and their stolen marriage-day<br/>
      Was Tybalt's doomsday, whose untimely death<br/>
      Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from this city,<br/>
      For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin'd.<br/>
      You, to remove that siege of grief from her,<br/>
      Betroth'd and would have married her perforce<br/>
      To County Paris; then comes she to me,<br/>
      And with wild looks bid me devise some means<br/>
      To rid her from this second marriage,<br/>
      Or in my cell there would she kill herself.<br/>
      Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,<br/>
      A sleeping potion, which so took effect<br/>
      As I intended, for it wrought on her<br/>
      The form of death; meantime I writ to Romeo<br/>
      That he should hither come as this dire night,<br/>
      To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,<br/>
      Being the time the potion's force should cease.<br/>
      But he which bore my letter, Friar John,<br/>

      Return'd my letter back. Then all alone,<br/>
      At the prefixed hour of her waking,<br/>
      Came I to take her from her kindred's vault,<br/>

      Till I conveniently could send to Romeo;<br/>
      But when I came, some minute ere the time<br/>
      Of her awaking, here untimely lay<br/>
      The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.<br/>
      She wakes, and I entreated her come forth<br/>
      And bear this work of heaven with patience;<br/>
      But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,<br/>
      And she too desperate would not go with me,<br/>
      But, as it seems, did violence on herself.<br/>
      All this I know, and to the marriage<br/>
      Her nurse is privy; and, if aught in this<br/>
      Miscarried by my fault, let my old life<br/>
