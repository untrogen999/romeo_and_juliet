                <p>
                    Little is known of the life of <name type="person">Arthur Brooke</name>, or Brooke, except that he
                    wrote <title type="work">Romeus and Juliet</title> (1562) and the next year published a book
                    entitled <title type="work">Agreement of Sundry Places of Scripture</title>, ... He died that same
                    year (<date>1563</date>), and an <title type="work">Epitaph</title> by <name type="person">George Turbervile</name>
                    informs us that he was "drowned in passing to Newhaven."
                </p>
                <p>
                    So far as I am aware, no editor or commentator has referred to the singular prose introduction
                    to the 1562 edition of <title type="work">Romeus and Juliet</title>. ... It is signed "Ar. Br."â€”the
                    form in which his name also appears on the title-page.

                    <p>
                        <name type="person">Juliet</name> is not fortunate in her parents. ... Her father is
                        <num type="age">sixty</num> or more years old, while her mother is about
                        <num type="age">twenty-eight</num>. ...

                        Earlier in the play, <name type="person">Capulet</name> says to <name type="person">Paris</name>: ...

                            "But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,
                            My will to her consent is but a part;
                            An she agree, within her scope of choice,
                            Lies my consent and fair according voice;"

                        Some critics have expressed surprise that <name type="person">Shakespeare</name> should have preluded the
                        main story of the drama with the "superfluous complication" of Romeo's love for Rosaline.
