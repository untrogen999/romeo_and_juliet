This is the Romeo and Juliet project for HUMAN-1030 Fall 2024. We're working on an analysis of that play to make an augmented reading view.

The project's done by four people:

* Myles: Documentation Officer and Web Designer
* Aania: Subject Expert
* Nidhi: Quality Control Officer
* Avi: Team Co-Ordinator and Web Designer Assistant

The link to our website with our augmented reading view is here: [Link](https://untrogen999.github.io/romeo_and_juliet/)

All the project's code is released under the public domain.
