Stepfile by Avi Zilberman to add sex and house attributes to all speakers in the play's XML.

For an XSLT solution, run the "xslt/avi_add_attributes_to_speakers.xsl" XSLT file on "xml/thePlay_MJB.xml". It does the same replacements as in this file, but automatically.

***

Speakers have any of the following sexes, or neither:

* "F" - Female
* "M" - Male
* "N" - Neither, unknown, or not given

Speakers also are in either of the houses, or neither:

* "M" - House of Montague
* "C" - House of Capulet
* "N" - Neither, unknown, or not given

I looked at the *DRAMATIS PERSONÃ†* section and looked at all the unique "@char" values, but didn't do anything more to get the character names.
